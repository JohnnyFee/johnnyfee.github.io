## Library

- [square/mortar](https://github.com/square/mortar/) A simple library that makes it easy to pair thin views with dedicated controllers, isolated from most of the vagaries of the Activity life cycle.
- [square/flow](https://github.com/square/flow) Name UI states, navigate between them, remember where you've been.
