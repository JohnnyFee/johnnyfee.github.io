## 基本概念

__Every QML document consists of two parts: an imports section and an object declaration section.__ The types and functionality most common to user interfaces are provided in the QtQuick import.

### What is QML?

QML is a user interface specification and programming language. It allows developers and designers alike to create highly performant, fluidly animated and visually appealing applications. QML offers a highly readable, declarative, JSON-like syntax with support for imperative JavaScript expressions combined with dynamic property bindings.

The QML language and engine infrastructure is provided by the [Qt QML](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtqml/qtqml-index.html) module. For in-depth information about the QML language, please see the [Qt QML](../qtqml/qtqml-index.html) module documentation.

### What is Qt Quick?

Qt Quick is the standard library of types and functionality for QML. It includes visual elements, interactive elements, animations, models and views, particle effects and shader effects. A QML application developer can get access to all of that functionality with a single import statement.

The QtQuick QML library is provided by the [Qt Quick](qtquick-index.html) module. For in-depth information about the various QML types and other functionality provided by Qt Quick, please see the [Qt Quick](qtquick-index.html) module documentation.

## Quick Start

Reference: [QtQuick 5.0: Quick Start Guide ](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qtquick-quickstart-basics.html)

### Importing and Using the QtQuick Module

To use the [QtQuick](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qtquick-module.html) module, a QML document needs to import it. The import syntax looks like this:

    import QtQuick 2.0

The types and functionality that [QtQuick](qtquick-module.html) provides can now be used in the QML document!

### Defining an Object Hierarchy

The object declaration in a QML document defines what will be displayed in the visual scene. [QtQuick](qtquick-module.html) provides the basic building blocks for all user interfaces, including objects to display images and text, and to handle user input.

A simple object declaration might be a colored rectangle with some text centered in it:

    Rectangle {
        width: 200
        height: 100
        color: "red"
    
        [Text](qml-qtquick2-text.html) {
            anchors.centerIn: parent
            text: "Hello, World!"
        }
    }

This defines an object hierarchy with a root [Rectangle](qml-qtquick2-rectangle.html) object which has a child [Text](qml-qtquick2-text.html) object. The parent of the [Text](qml-qtquick2-text.html) object is automatically set to the [Rectangle](qml-qtquick2-rectangle.html), and similarly, the [Text](qml-qtquick2-text.html) object is added to the children property of the [Rectangle](qml-qtquick2-rectangle.html) object, by QML.

### Putting it Together

The [Rectangle](qml-qtquick2-rectangle.html) and [Text](qml-qtquick2-text.html) types used in the above example are both provided by the [QtQuick](qtquick-module.html) import. To use them, we need to import [QtQuick](qtquick-module.html). Putting the import and object declaration together, we get a complete QML document:

    import QtQuick 2.0
    
    Rectangle {
        width: 200
        height: 100
        color: "red"
    
        Text {
            anchors.centerIn: parent
            text: "Hello, World!"
        }
    }
