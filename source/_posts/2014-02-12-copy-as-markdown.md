When you select nothing in the page, the page's link will be written to the cliboard, the content is like this: `[window.title](location.href)`.

Except clicking the extension icon, there is another easy way to do the same action with a shortcut: **Command+Shift+C** on Mac or **Ctrl+Shift+C** on Other OS. When the default command conflit with yours, you can change it in the Chrome's tab `chrome://extensions/`.
