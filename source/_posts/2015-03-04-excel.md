### Entering Symbols With The Keyboard 

See [Special Characters In Excel](http://www.cpearson.com/excel/chars.htm)

If you know the code number, you can enter that character any time by holding down the ALT key, and typing the 4-digit code number on the numeric keypad (the keys on the far right of your keyboard -- do not use the "normal" number keys above the letter keys).  Even though character code numbers are only three digits (between 0 and 255), you must type in the leading zeros to ensure that you get the proper character.   For example, to enter in the British Pound sign, whose code is 163, hold down the ALT key, and type 0163 on the numeric keypad.
