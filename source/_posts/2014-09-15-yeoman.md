## What's Yeoman?

Yeoman helps you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.

The Yeoman workflow is comprised of three types of tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a web app: the scaffolding tool (yo), the build tool (Grunt, Gulp, etc) and the package manager (like Bower and npm).

## Quick Start

First, you'll need to install `yo`:

    $ npm install -g yo

To scaffold a web application, you'll need to install the `generator-webapp` generator:

```sh
$ npm install -g generator-webapp
```

This is the default web application generator that will scaffold out a project containing [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), and [Bootstrap](http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap). You'll have a choice during the interactive prompts to not include many of these.

Now that the generator is installed, create a directory for your new project

```sh
$ mkdir my-yo-project
$ cd my-yo-project
```

and then run:

```sh
$ yo webapp
```
