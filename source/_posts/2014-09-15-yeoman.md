## What's Yeoman?

[The web's scaffolding tool for modern webapps](http://yeoman.io/)

Yeoman helps you kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.

The Yeoman workflow is comprised of three types of tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a web app: the scaffolding tool (yo), the build tool (Grunt, Gulp, etc) and the package manager (like Bower and npm).

<!-- more -->

## Quick Start

First, you'll need to install `yo`:

    $ npm install -g yo

To scaffold a web application, you'll need to install the `generator-webapp` generator:

```sh
$ npm install -g generator-webapp
```

This is the default web application generator that will scaffold out a project containing [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), and [Bootstrap](http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap). You'll have a choice during the interactive prompts to not include many of these.

Now that the generator is installed, create a directory for your new project

```sh
$ mkdir my-yo-project
$ cd my-yo-project
```

and then run:

```sh
$ yo webapp
```

See also [Let's Scaffold a Web App with Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/codelab.html).

## Bower

### Using Bower with a project scaffolded using yo

To create a basic web app with a dependency on a jQuery plug-in:

```sh
# Scaffold a new application.
$ yo webapp

# Search Bower's registry for the plug-in we want.
$ bower search jquery-pjax

# Install it and save it to bower.json
$ bower install jquery-pjax --save

# If you're using RequireJS...
# (be aware that currently the webapp generator does not include RequireJS and the following command only applies to generators that do)
$ grunt bower
# Injects your Bower dependencies into your RequireJS configuration.

# If you're not using RequireJS...
$ grunt bowerInstall
# Injects your dependencies into your index.html file.
```

_Your chosen generator may not include the grunt tasks "bower" and "bowerInstall". You can read more about how to install and use these at [grunt-bower-requirejs](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-bower-requirejs) and [grunt-bower-install](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-bower-install)._

## Grunt

### Grunt commands

```sh
# Preview an app you have generated (with Livereload).
$ grunt serve

# Run the unit tests for an app.
$ grunt test

# Build an optimized, production-ready version of your app.
$ grunt

# Build and preview the production-ready app
$ grunt serve:dist
```

### FAQ

- [No such file or directory - bower.json - Yeoman](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25784986/yeoman-grunt-no-such-file-or-directory-bower-json)

    I had the same problem try commenting the line 166 in your `Gruntfile.js` : 

    I did it and it should look like this :

        // Automatically inject Bower components into the app
        wiredep: {
          options: {
            //cwd: '<%= yeoman.app %>'
          },

    Then run again your server with :

        grunt serve

        npm install grunt-karma --save-dev

- 执行 grunt default 任务时，根据 Warning 提示，需要安装 karma-phantomjs-launcher：

        npm install karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev

- [gruntjs - yeoman webapp - grunt fontawesome and bootstrap font files copy task - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24123225/yeoman-webapp-grunt-fontawesome-and-bootstrap-font-files-copy-task)

    在 copy.dist 任务中添加以下代码，直接拷贝：

        copy: {
        dist: {
            files: [{
                expand: true,
                cwd: '<%= yeoman.app %>/../bower_components/font-awesome/fonts/',
                src: ['**'],
                dest: '<%= yeoman.dist %>/fonts/'
            }]
        }
