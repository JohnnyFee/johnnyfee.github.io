## Anatomy of an AngularJS Application

Loading the Script:

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.4/angular.min.js"></script>
    

If you’re building an all-Angular application:

    <html ng-app>
    …
    </html>

Manage only a part of the page by placing it on some element like a <div>within the page:

    <html>
        …
        <div ng-app>
        …
        </div>
        …
    </html>

### Templates and Data Binding

1. A user requests the first page of your application.
2. The user’s browser makes an HTTP connection to your server and loads the index.html page containing your template.
3. Angular loads into the page, waits for the page to be fully loaded, and then looks for ng-app to define its template boundaries.
4. Angular traverses the template and looks for directives and bindings. This results in registration of listeners and DOM manipulation, as well as fetching initial data from the server. The end result of this work is that the app is bootstrapped and the template is converted into view as a DOM.
5. You connect to your server to load additional data you need to show the user as needed.

Steps 1 through 3 are standard for every Angular app. It’s in steps 4 and 5 that you have choices. These steps can happen synchronously or asynchronously. For performance, the data your app needs to display to the user on the first view can come down with the HTML template to avoid multiple requests.

### Displaying Text

It has two equivalent forms. One we’ve seen with double-curly braces:

    <p>{{greeting}}</p>

Then there’s an attribute-based directive called ng-bind:

    <p ng-bind="greeting"></p>

如何使用这两种方式：

- With the double-curly syntax, on the very first page load of your application’s index.html, there’s a chance that your user will see the un-rendered template before Angular has a chance to replace the curlies with your data. Subsequent views won’t suffer from this. The reason is that the browser loads the HTML page, renders it, and only then does Angular get a chance to interpret it as you intended.

- The good news is that you can still use {{ }} in the majority of your templates. For the data binding you do in your index.html page, however, use ng-bind instead. That way, your users will see nothing until the data has loaded.

### Form Inputs

you can use the ng-model attribute to bind elements to your model properties:

    <form ng-controller="SomeController">
      <input type="checkbox" ng-model="youCheckedIt">
    </form>

This means that:

- When the user checks the box, a property called youCheckedIt on the SomeController’s $scope will become true. Unchecking the box makes youCheckedIt false.
- If you set $scope.youCheckedIt to true in SomeController, the box becomes checked in the UI. Setting it to false unchecks the box.

you can call `$watch()` with an expression to observe and a callback that gets invoked whenever that expression changes:

    <form ng-controller="StartUpController">
        Starting: <input ng-model="funding.startingEstimate">
        Recommendation: {{funding.needed}}
    </form>


    function StartUpController($scope) {
      $scope.funding = { startingEstimate: 0 };

      computeNeeded = function() {
        $scope.funding.needed = $scope.funding.startingEstimate * 10;
      };

      $scope.$watch('funding.startingEstimate', computeNeeded);
    }

If you have a form that groups inputs, you can use the ng-submit directive on the form itself to specify a function to call when the form submits:

    <form ng-submit="requestFunding()" ng-controller="StartUpController">
      Starting: <input ng-change="computeNeeded()" ng-model="startingEstimate">
      Recommendation: {{needed}}
      <button>Fund my startup!</button>
    </form>

The ng-submit directive also automatically prevents the browser from doing its default POST action when it tries to submit the form.

### Lists, Tables, and Other Repeated Elements

`ng-repeat` creates a copy of a set of elements once for every item in a collection.

To display this list of students, we can do something like the following:

    <ul ng-controller=''>
      <li ng-repeat='student in students'>
        <a href='/student/view/{{student.id}}'>{{student.name}}</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    var students = [{name:'Mary Contrary', id:'1'},
                    {name:'Jack Sprat', id:'2'},
                    {name:'Jill Hill', id:'3'}];

    function StudentListController($scope) {
      $scope.students = students;
    }

As we’ve seen before, changing the student’s array will automatically change the rendered list. If we were to do something like inserting a new student into the list:

    <ul ng-controller=''>
      <li ng-repeat='student in students'>
        <a href='/student/view/{{student.id}}'>{{student.name}}</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <button ng-click="insertTom()">Insert</button>

    var students = [{name:'Mary Contrary', id:'1'},
                {name:'Jack Sprat', id:'2'},
                {name:'Jill Hill', id:'3'}];

    function StudentListController($scope) {
      $scope.students = students;

      $scope.insertTom = function () {
        $scope.students.splice(1, 0, {name:'Tom Thumb', id:'4'});
      };
    }

The ng-repeat directive also gives you references to the index of the current element via $index, and booleans that tell you if you’re on the first element, somewhere in the middle, or the last element of the collection with $first, $middle, and $last.
You might imagine using the $index to label rows in a table. Given a template like this:

    <table ng-controller='AlbumController'>
      <tr ng-repeat='track in album'>
        <td>{{$index + 1}}</td>
        <td>{{track.name}}</td>
        <td>{{track.duration}}</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

and this controller:

    var album = [{name:'Southwest Serenade', duration: '2:34'},
             {name:'Northern Light Waltz', duration: '3:21'},
             {name:'Eastern Tango', duration: '17:45'}];

    function AlbumController($scope) {
      $scope.album = album;
    }

### Hiding and Showing

These directives work by setting the element styles to display:block to show and display:none to hide as appropriate. Let’s take a fictitious example where we’re building the control panel for a Death Ray.

    <div ng-controller='DeathrayMenuController'>
      <button ng-click='toggleMenu()'>Toggle Menu</button>
      <ul ng-show='menuState.show'>
        <li ng-click='stun()'>Stun</li>
        <li ng-click='disintegrate()'>Disintegrate</li>
        <li ng-click='erase()'>Erase from history</li>
      </ul>
    <div/>

    function DeathrayMenuController($scope) {
      $scope.menuState.show = false;

      $scope.toggleMenu = function() {
        $scope.menuState.show = !$scope.menuState.show;
      };

      // death ray functions left as exercise to reader
    }


### CSS Classes and Styles

Angular provides the ng-class and ng-style directives. Each of them takes an expression. The result of evaluating this expression can be one of the following:

* A string representing space-delimited class names
* An array of class names
* A map of class names to boolean values

Let’s imagine that you want to display errors and warnings to your users in a standard location in the application’s header. Using the ng-class directive, you could do something like this:

    .error {
      background-color: red;
    }

    .warning {
      background-color: yellow;
    }

    <div ng-controller='HeaderController'>
      ...
      <div ng-class='{error: isError, warning: isWarning}'>{{messageText}}</div>
      …
      <button ng-click='showError()'>Simulate Error</button>
      <button ng-click='showWarning()'>Simulate Warning</button>
    </div>

    function HeaderController($scope) {
      $scope.isError = false;
      $scope.isWarning = false;

      $scope.showError = function() {
        $scope.messageText = 'This is an error!';
        $scope.isError = true;
        $scope.isWarning = false;
      };

    $scope.showWarning = function() {
        $scope.messageText = 'Just a warning.  Please carry on.';
        $scope.isWarning = true;
        $scope.isError = false;
      };
    }

You can even do nifty things like highlighting a selected row in a table. Let’s say we’re building a restaurant directory and we want to highlight a row that the user clicks on.
In our CSS, we set up the style for a highlighted row:

    .selected {
      background-color: lightgreen;
    }

In the template, we set ng-class to {selected: $index==selectedRow}. This has the effect of setting the selected class when our model property called selectedRow matches the ng-repeat’s $index. We’ll also set up an ng-click to notify our controller as to which row the user clicks:

    <table ng-controller='RestaurantTableController'>
      <tr ng-repeat='restaurant in directory' ng-click='selectRestaurant($index)'
          ng-class='{selected: $index==selectedRow}'>
        <td>{{restaurant.name}}</td>
        <td>{{restaurant.cuisine}}</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

In our JavaScript, we just set up some dummy restaurants and create the selectRow function:

    function RestaurantTableController($scope) {
      $scope.directory = [{name:'The Handsome Heifer', cuisine:'BBQ'},
                          {name:'Green's Green Greens', cuisine:'Salads'},
                          {name:'House of Fine Fish', cuisine:'Seafood'}];

      $scope.selectRestaurant = function(row) {
        $scope.selectedRow = row;
      };
    }

### Considerations for src and href Attributes

When data binding to an `<img>` or `<a>` tag, the obvious path of using {{ }} in the src or href attributes won’t work well. Because browsers are aggressive about loading images parallel to other content, Angular doesn’t get a chance to intercept data binding requests. While the obvious syntax for an `<img> `might be:

    <img src="/images/cats/{{favoriteCat}}">

Instead, you should use the `ng-src` attribute and write your template as:

    <img ng-src="/images/cats/{{favoriteCat}}">

Similarly, for the `<a>` tag, you should use `ng-href`:

    <a ng-href="/shop/category={{numberOfBalloons}}">some text</a>

### Expressions

The goal behind the expressions that you use in templates is to let you be as clever as you need to be to create hooks between your template, your application logic, and your data, but at the same time prevent application logic from sneaking into the template.

Until this point, we’ve been mostly using references to data primitives as the expressions passed to Angular directives. But these expressions can do much more. You can do simple math (+, -, /, *, %), make comparisons (==, !=, >, <, >=), perform boolean logic (&&, ||, !) and bitwise operations (\^, &, |). 

You can call functions you expose on $scope in your controller and you can reference arrays and object notation ([ ], { }, .).
All of these are valid examples of expressions:

    <div ng-controller='SomeController'>
      <div>{{recompute() / 10}}</div>
      <ul ng-repeat='thing in things'>
        <li ng-class='{highlight: $index % 4 >= threshold($index)}'>
          {{otherFunction($index)}}
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>


The first expression here, recompute() / 10, while valid, is a good example of putting logic in the template, and should be avoided. Keeping a separation of responsibilities between your view and controllers ensures that they’re easy to reason and easy to test.

While you can do quite a lot with expressions, they are computed with a custom parser that’s part of Angular. They are not evaluated using JavaScript’s eval(), and are considerably more restrictive.

Instead, they are evaluated using a custom parser that comes with Angular. In it, you won’t find looping constructs (for, while, and so on), flow-of-control operators (if-else, throw) or operators that modify data (++, --). When you need these types of operations, do them in your controller or via a directive.

Though expressions are more restrictive than JavaScript in many ways, they are more forgiving to undefined and null. Instead of throwing a NullPointerException error, templates will simply render nothing. This allows you to safely use model values that haven’t been set yet, and have them appear in the UI as soon as they get populated.

### Observing Model Changes with $watch

The function’s signature is:

    $watch(watchFn, watchAction, deepWatch) 

The details of each parameter are as follows:

- watchFn

    This parameter is a string with an Angular expression or a function that returns the current value of the model that you want to watch. This expression will be evaluated multiple times, so you need to make sure that it has no side effects. That is, it can be called multiple times without changing state. For the same reason, watch expressions should be computationally cheap. If you’ve passed in an Angular expression in a string, it will be evaluated against objects available to the scope it’s called on.

- watchAction

    This is the function or expression to be called when the watchFn changes. In the function form, it receives the new and old values of watchFn as well as a reference to the scope. Its signature is function(newValue, oldValue, scope).

- deepWatch

    If set to true, this optional boolean parameter tells Angular to examine each property within the watched object for changes. You’d use this if you wanted to watch individual elements in an array or properties in an object instead of just a simple value. As Angular needs to walk the array or object, this can be computationally expensive if the collection is large.

The $watch function returns a function that will de-register the listener when you no longer want to receive change notifications.
If we wanted to watch a property and then later de-register it, we would use the following:

    ...
    var dereg = $scope.$watch('someModel.someProperty', callbackOnChange());
    …
    dereg();

Let’s say that we want to apply a $10 discount when the customer adds more than $100 worth of merchandise to her cart. For a template, we’ll use:

    <div ng-controller="CartController">
      <div ng-repeat="item in items">
        <span>{{item.title}}</span>
        <input ng-model="item.quantity">
        <span>{{item.price | currency}}</span>
        <span>{{item.price * item.quantity | currency}}</span>
      </div>
      <div>Total: {{totalCart() | currency}}</div>
      <div>Discount: {{bill.discount | currency}}</div>
      <div>Subtotal: {{subtotal() | currency}}</div>
    </div>

With a CartController, it would look like the following:

    function CartController($scope) {
      $scope.bill = {};

      $scope.items = [
        {title: 'Paint pots', quantity: 8, price: 3.95},
        {title: 'Polka dots', quantity: 17, price: 12.95},
        {title: 'Pebbles', quantity: 5, price: 6.95}
      ];

      $scope.totalCart = function() {
        var total = 0;
        for (var i = 0, len = $scope.items.length; i < len; i++) {
          total = total + $scope.items[i].price * $scope.items[i].quantity;
        }

        return total;
      }

      $scope.subtotal = function() {
        return $scope.totalCart() - $scope.discount;
      };

      function calculateDiscount(newValue, oldValue, scope) {
        $scope.bill.discount = newValue > 100 ? 10 : 0;
      }

      $scope.$watch($scope.totalCart, calculateDiscount);
    }

__Watching multiple things__

What if you want to watch multiple properties or objects and execute a function whenever any of them change? You’d have two basic options:

* Put them into an array or object and pass in deepWatch as true.
* Watch a concatenated value of the properties.

In the first case, if you’ve got an object with two properties _a_ and _b_ in your scope, and want to execute the callMe() function on change, you could watch both of them, like so:

$scope.$watch('things.a + things.b', callMe(...)); Of course, _a_ and _b_ could be on different objects, and you could make the list as long as you like. If the list is long, you would likely write a function that returns the concatenated value rather than relying on an expression for the logic. In the second case, you might want to watch all the properties on the things object. In this case, you could do this:$scope.$watch('things', callMe(...), true);

__Performance Considerations in watch()__


The preceding example executes correctly, but there is a potential problem with performance. Though it isn’t obvious, if you put a debugger breakpoint in totalCart(), you’d see that it gets called six times to render this page. Though you’d never notice it in this application, in more complex apps, running it six times could be an issue.

Why six? Three of them we can trace pretty easily, as it runs one time each in:

* The template as {{totalCart() | currency}}
* The subtotal() function
* The $watch() function

Then Angular runs all of these again, bringing us to six. Angular does this to verify that transitive changes in your model have fully propagated and your model has _settled_ . Angular does this checking by making a copy of all watched properties and comparing them to the current value to see if they’ve changed. In fact, Angular may run this up to ten times to ensure full propagation. If changes are still occurring after ten iterations, Angular exits with an error. If that occurs, you probably have a dependency loop that you’ll need to fix.

Though you currently need to worry about this, by the time you’ve finished this book it may be a non-issue. While Angular has had to implement data binding in JavaScript, we’ve been working with the TC39 folks on a low-level native implementation called[Object.observe()](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/11/Respond-to-change-with-Object-observe). With this in place, Angular will automatically use Object.observe() wherever present to give you native-speed data binding.

As you’ll see in the next chapter, Angular has a nice Chrome debugging extension called Batarang that will automatically highlight expensive data bindings for you.

Now that we know about this issue, there are a few ways we can solve it. One way would be to create a $watch on changes to the items array and just recalculate the total, discount, and subtotal as properties on the $scope.

To do this, we’d update the template to use these properties:

    <div>Total: {{bill.total | currency}}</div>
    <div>Discount: {{bill.discount | currency}}</div>
    <div>Subtotal: {{bill.subtotal | currency}}</div>

Then, in JavaScript, we’d watch the items array, and call a function to calculate the totals on any change to that array, like so:

    function CartController($scope) {
      $scope.bill = {};

      $scope.items = [
        {title: 'Paint pots', quantity: 8, price: 3.95},
        {title: 'Polka dots', quantity: 17, price: 12.95},
        {title: 'Pebbles', quantity: 5, price: 6.95}
      ];

      var calculateTotals = function() {
        var total = 0;
        for (var i = 0, len = $scope.items.length; i < len; i++) {
          total = total + $scope.items[i].price * $scope.items[i].quantity;
        }
        $scope.bill.totalCart = total;
        $scope.bill.discount = total > 100 ? 10 : 0;
        $scope.bill.subtotal = total - $scope.bill.discount;
      };

      $scope.$watch('items', calculateTotals, true);
    }

Notice here that the $watch specified items as a string. This is possible because the $watch function can take either a function (as we did previously) or a string. If a string is passed to the $watch function, then it will be evaluated as an expression in the scope of the $scope it’s called on.

This strategy might work well for your app. However, since we’re watching the items array, Angular will have to make a copy of it to compare it for us. For a large list of items, it may perform better if we just recalculate the bill properties every time Angular evaluates the page. We can do this by creating a $watch with only a watchFn that will recalculate our properties like this:


    $scope.$watch(function() {
      var total = 0;
      for (var i = 0; i < $scope.items.length; i++) {
        total = total + $scope.items[i].price * $scope.items[i].quantity;
      }
      $scope.bill.totalCart = total;
      $scope.bill.discount = total > 100 ? 10 : 0;
      $scope.bill.subtotal = total - $scope.bill.discount;
    });

### Formatting Data with Filters

Filters allow you to declare how to transform data for display to the user within an interpolation in your template. The syntax for using filters is:

    {{ expression | filterName : parameter1 : ...parameterN }} 

where expression is any Angular expression, filterName is the name of the filter you want to use, and the parameters to the filter are separated by colons. The parameters themselves can be any valid Angular expression.

Angular comes with several filters, like currency, which we’ve seen:

    {{12.9 | currency}}

This bit of code will display the following: $12.90 We put this declaration in the view (rather than in the controller or model) because the dollar sign in front of the number is only important to humans, and not to the logic we use to process the number.

Other filters that come with Angular include date, number, uppercase, and more.

Filters can also be chained with additional pipe symbols in the binding. For example, we can format the previous example for no digits after the decimal by adding the number filter, which takes the number of decimals to round to as a parameter. So:

    {{12.9 | currency | number:0 }} 

displays: $13

You’re not limited to the bundled filters, and it is simple to write your own. If we wanted to create a filter that title-cased strings for our headings, for example, we could do so as follows:

    var homeModule = angular.module('HomeModule', []);
    homeModule.filter('titleCase', function() {
      var titleCaseFilter = function(input) {
        var words = input.split(' ');
        for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
          words[i] = words[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + words[i].slice(1);
        }
        return words.join(' ');
      };
      return titleCaseFilter;
    });
With a template like this:

    <body ng-app='HomeModule' ng-controller="HomeController">
      <h1>{{pageHeading | titleCase}}</h1>
    </body>

and inserting the pageHeading as a model variable via a controller:

    function HomeController($scope) {
      $scope.pageHeading = 'behold the majesty of your page title';
    }

### Changing Views with Routes and $location

We’re building an email app that will easily win out over Gmail, Hotmail, and all the others. We’ll call it…A-Mail.

index.html

    <html ng-app="AMail">
      <head>
        <script src="src/angular.js"></script>
        <script src="src/controllers.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>A-Mail</h1>
        <div ng-view></div>
      </body>
    </html>

As our view templates will be inserted into the shell we just created, we can write them as partial HTML documents. For the email list, we’ll use ng-repeat to iterate through a list of messages and render them into a table.
list.html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Sender</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Subject</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Date</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr ng-repeat='message in messages'>
        <td>{{message.sender}}</td>
        <td><a href='#/view/{{message.id}}'>{{message.subject}}</td>
        <td>{{message.date}}</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

To create this message detail view, we’ll create a template that displays properties from a single message object.

detail.html

    <div><strong>Subject:</strong> {{message.subject}}</div>
    <div><strong>Sender:</strong> {{message.sender}}</div>
    <div><strong>Date:</strong> {{message.date}}</div>
    <div>
        <strong>To:</strong>
        <span ng-repeat='recipient in message.recipients'>{{recipient}} </span>
    <div>{{message.message}}</div>
    <a href='#/'>Back to message list</a>

Now, to associate these templates with some controllers, we’ll configure the $routeProvider with the URLs that invoke our controllers and templates.

controllers.js

    // Create a module for our core AMail services
    var aMailServices = angular.module('AMail', []);

    // Set up our mappings between URLs, templates, and controllers
    function emailRouteConfig($routeProvider) {
      $routeProvider.
      when('/', {
        controller: ListController,
        templateUrl: 'list.html'
      }).
    // Notice that for the detail view, we specify a parameterized URL component
    // by placing a colon in front of the id
      when('/view/:id', {
        controller: DetailController,
        templateUrl: 'detail.html'
      }).
      otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/'
      });
    }

    // Set up our route so the AMail service can find it
    aMailServices.config(emailRouteConfig);

    // Some fake emails
    messages = [{
      id: 0, sender: 'jean@somecompany.com', subject: 'Hi there, old friend',
      date: 'Dec 7, 2013 12:32:00', recipients: ['greg@somecompany.com'],
      message: 'Hey, we should get together for lunch sometime and catch up.'
      +'There are many things we should collaborate on this year.'
    }, ...];

    // Publish our messages for the list template
    function ListController($scope) {
      $scope.messages = messages;
    }

    // Get the message id from the route (parsed from the URL) and use it to
    // find the right message object.
    function DetailController($scope, $routeParams) {
      $scope.message = messages[$routeParams.id];
    }

We’ve created the basic structure for an app with many views. We switch views by changing the URL. This means that the forward and back buttons just work for users. Users are able to bookmark and email links to views within the app, even though there is only one real HTML page.

### Talking to Servers

    function ShoppingController($scope, $http) {
      $http.get('/products').success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
        $scope.items = data;
      });
    }

### Validating User Input

    <h1>Sign Up</h1>
    <form name='addUserForm' ng-controller="AddUserController">
      <div ng-show='message'>{{message}}</div>
      <div>First name: <input name='firstName' ng-model='user.first' required></div>
      <div>Last name: <input ng-model='user.last' required></div>
      <div>Email: <input type='email' ng-model='user.email' required></div>
      <div>Age: <input type='number'
                       ng-model='user.age'
                       ng-maxlength='3'
                       ng-min='1'></div>
      <div><button ng-click='addUser()'
                   ng-disabled='!addUserForm.$valid'>Submit</button>
    </ng-form>

Notice that we’re using the required attribute and input types for email and number from HTML5 to do our validation on some of the fields. This works great with Angular, and in older non-HTML5 browsers, Angular will polyfill these with directives that perform the same jobs.

    function AddUserController($scope) {
      $scope.message = '';

      $scope.addUser = function () {
        // TODO for the reader: actually save user to database...
        $scope.message = 'Thanks, ' + $scope.user.first + ', we added you!';
      };
    }

Inside the controller, we can access the validation state of the form through a property called $valid. Angular will set this to true when all the inputs in the form are valid. We can use this $valid property to do nifty things such as disabling the Submit button when the form isn’t completed yet.

We can prevent form submission in an invalid state by adding ng-disabled to the Submit button:

    <button ng-disabled='!addUserForm.$valid'>Submit</button>

## Developing in AngularJS

### Server

__With Yeoman__

Yeoman makes it simple for you to start a web server and serve all your static and AngularJS-related files. Just execute the following command:

    yeoman server

and it will start up a server and open your browser with the main page of your AngularJS application. It will even refresh the browser whenever you make changes to your source code. How cool is that?

__Express__

    npm install -g express

// available at chapter3/sample-app/web-server.js

    var express = require("express"),
      app     = express(),
      port    = parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) || 8080;

    app.configure(function(){
      app.use(express.methodOverride());
      app.use(express.bodyParser());
      app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/'));
      app.use(app.router);
    });

    app.listen(port);
    console.log('Now serving the app at http://localhost:' + port + '/app');

Run:

    node web-server.js

### Testing

#### Karma’s

Karma’s main reason for existence is to make your test-driven development (TDD) workflow simple, fast, and fun. It uses[NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org/) and [SocketIO](http://www.socket.io/) (you don’t need to know what they are, just assume that they are awesome, cool libraries) to allow running your code, and tests in multiple browsers at insanely fast speeds. Go find out more at [https://github.com/vojtajina/karma/](https://github.com/vojtajina/karma/).

1. Set up Karma

        npm install -g karma

2. Getting your config file up

    If you used Yeoman to create your app skeleton, then you already have a ready-made Karma config file waiting for you to use. If not, just go ahead and execute the following command from the base folder of your application directory: 

        karma init

    in your terminal console, and it will generate a dummy config file ( _karma.conf.js_ ) for you to edit to your liking, with some pretty standard defaults. You can use that.

3. Starting the Karma server

    Just run the following command: 

        karma start [optionalPathToConfigFile]

    This will start the Karma server on port 9876 (the default, which you can change by editing the _karma.conf.js_ file from the previous step). While Karma should open up a browser and capture it automatically, it will print all the instructions needed to capture another browser in the console. If you are too lazy to do that, just go to [http://localhost:9876](http://localhost:9876/) in another browser or device, and you are good to start running tests in multiple browsers.

4. Running the tests

    Execute the following command: 

        karma run

    That’s it. You should get your results printed right in the console where you ran the command.


#### Unit Tests

AngularJS makes it easy to write your unit tests, and supports the Jasmine style of writing tests by default (as does Karma). Jasmine is what we call a behavior-driven development framework, which allows you to write specifications that denote how your code should behave. A sample test in Jasmine might look something like this.
describe("MyController:", function() {

    it("to work correctly", function() {
        var a = 12;
        var b = a;

        expect(a).toBe(b);
        expect(a).not.toBe(null);
      });
    });

AngularJS provides some nice mockups, as well as testing functions, to allow you to create services, controllers, and filters right in your unit tests, as well as mock out HttpRequests and the like.

Karma does not have plug-ins (yet!) for all the latest and greatest IDEs, but you don’t really need any. All you need to do is add a shortcut command to execute “karma start” and “karma run” from within your IDE. This can usually be done by adding a simple script to execute, or the actual shell command, depending on your choice of editor. You should see the results every time it finishes running, of course.

### Batarang

Batarang is a Chrome extension that adds AngularJS knowledge to the built-in Developer Tools suite in Google Chrome. 

### Yeoman: Optimizing Your Workflow

[Yeoman - Modern workflows for modern webapps](http://yeoman.io/)


1. Installing Yeoman

        npm install -g yo

2. Starting a Fresh AngularJS project

        yeoman init angular

3. Running Your Server
        
        yeoman server

4. Adding New Routes, Views, and Controllers

        yeoman init angular:route routeName

    So if you ended up running yeoman init angular:route home, it would:

    * Create a _home.js_ controller skeleton in the _app/scripts/controllers_ folder
    * Create a _home.js_ test spec skeleton in the _test/specs/controllers_ folder
    * Add the _home.html_ template to the _app/views_ folder
    * Hook up the home route in the main app module ( _app/scripts/app.js_ file)

5. Testing

    We’ve already seen how ridiculously easy it is to start and run tests using Karma. In the end, just two commands were needed to run all your unit tests.

    Yeoman makes it easier (if you can believe it). Anytime you generate a file using Yeoman, it also creates a testing stub for you to fill out. Once you’ve installed Karma, running tests with Yeoman is as simple as executing the following command:

        yeoman test

6. Building Your Project

    Building the production-ready version of your app can be a pain, or at least involve many steps. Yeoman alleviates some of this by allowing you to:

    * Concatenate all your JS Scripts into one file
    * Version your files
    * Optimize images
    * Generate Application Cache manifests

    All these benefits come from just one command:

        yeoman build

## Model View Controller

Use primitives as model：

    <html ng-app>
    <body ng-controller="TextController">
      <p>{{someText}}</p>

      <script
          src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.1/angular.min.js">
      </script>

      <script>
        function TextController($scope) {
          $scope.someText = 'You have started your journey.';
        }
      </script>
    </body>
    </html>

Though this primitive-style model works in simple cases, for most applications you’ll want to create a model object to contain your data.

    <html ng-app='myApp'>
    <body ng-controller='TextController'>
      <p>{{someText.message}}</p>

    <script
        src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.1/angular.min.js">
    </script>

    <script>
      var myAppModule = angular.module('myApp', []);

      myAppModule.controller('TextController',
          function($scope) {
        var someText = {};
        someText.message = 'You have started your journey.';
        $scope.someText = someText;
      });
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>

In this version, we told our ng-app element about the name of our module, myApp.

Controllers have three responsibilities in your app:

* Set up the initial state in your application’s model
* Expose model and functions to the view (UI template) through $scope
* Watch other parts of the model for changes and take action.

    <div ng-controller="ParentController">
      <div ng-controller="ChildController">...</div>
    </div>

Though we express this as nested controllers, the actual nesting happens in scopes. The $scope passed to a nested controller prototypically inherits from its parent controller’s $scope. In this case, this means that the $scope passed to ChildController will have access to all the properties of the $scope passed to ParentController.

You can think of scopes as a context that you use to make changes to your model observable.

### Services

Services are singleton (single-instance) objects that carry out the tasks necessary to support your application’s functionality. Angular comes with many services like $location, for interacting with the browser’s location, $route, for switching views based on location (URL) changes, and $http, for communicating with servers.

With modules, and the dependency injection we get from them, we can write our controller much more simply, like this:

    function ShoppingController($scope, Items) {
      $scope.items = Items.query();
    }

You can, and should, create your own services to do all of the tasks unique to your application. Services can be shared across any controllers that need them. As such, they’re a good mechanism to use when you need to communicate across controllers and share state. Angular’s bundled services start with a $, so while you can name them anything you like, its a good idea to avoid starting them with $ to avoid naming collisions.

You define services with the module object’s API. There are three functions for creating generic services, with different levels of complexity and ability:

- `provider(name, Object OR constructor())` A configurable service with complex creation logic. If you pass an Object, it should have a function named $get that returns an instance of the service. Otherwise, Angular assumes you’ve passed a constructor that, when called, creates the instance.

- `factory(name, $getFunction())` A non-configurable service with complex creation logic. You specify a function that, when called, returns the service instance. You could think of this as `provider(name, { $get: $getFunction() } )`.

- `service(name, constructor())` A non-configurable service with simple creation logic. Like the constructor option with provider, Angular calls it to 

We’ll look at the configuration option for provider() later, but let’s discuss an example with factory() for our preceding Items example. We can write the service like this:

    // Create a module to support our shopping views
    var shoppingModule = angular.module('ShoppingModule', []);

    // Set up the service factory to create our Items interface to the
    // server-side database
    shoppingModule.factory('Items', function() {
      var items = {};
      items.query = function() {
        // In real apps, we'd pull this data from the server...
        return [
          {title: 'Paint pots', description: 'Pots full of paint', price: 3.95},
          {title: 'Polka dots', description: 'Dots with polka, price: 2.95},
          {title: 'Pebbles', description: 'Just little rocks', price: 6.95}
        ];
      };
      return items;
    });

When Angular creates the ShoppingController, it will pass in $scope and the new Items service that we’ve just defined. This is done by parameter name matching. That is, Angular looks at the function signature for our ShoppingController class, and notices that it is asking for an Items object. Since we’ve defined Items as a service, it knows where to get it.

The result of looking up these dependencies as strings means that the arguments of injectable functions like controller constructors are order-independent. So instead of this:

    function ShoppingController($scope, Items) {...}

we can write this:

    function ShoppingController(Items, $scope) {...}

and it all still functions as we intended.
To get this to work with our template, we need to tell the ng-app directive the name of our module, like the following:

    <html ng-app='ShoppingModule'>

To complete the example, we could implement the rest of the template as:

    <body ng-controller="ShoppingController">
      <h1>Shop!</h1>
      <table>
          <td>{{item.title}}</td>
          <td>{{item.description}}</td>
          <td>{{item.price | currency}}</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

Let's look another example:

    // This file is app/scripts/services/services.js

    var services = angular.module('guthub.services', ['ngResource']);

    services.factory('Recipe', ['$resource',
        function($resource) {
      return $resource('/recipes/:id', {id: '@id'});
    }]);

There is a recipe service, which returns what we call an Angular Resource. With just that single line of code—return $resource—(and of course, a dependency on the guthub.services module), we can now put recipe as an argument in any of our controllers, and it will be injected into the controller. Furthermore, each recipe object has the following methods built in:

* Recipe.get()
* Recipe.save()
* Recipe.query()
* Recipe.remove()
* Recipe.delete()

> If you are going to use Recipe.delete, and want your application to work in IE, you will have to call it like so: Recipe[delete](). This is because delete is a keyword in IE.

The line of code that declares the resource—return $resource—also does a few more nice things for us:

1. Notice the :id in the URL specified for the RESTful resource. It basically says that when you make any query (say, Recipe.get()), if you pass in an object with an id field, then the value of that field will be added to the end of the URL.

  That is, calling Recipe.get({id: 15}) will make a call to _/recipe/15_ .

2. What about that second object? The {id: _@id_}? Well, as they say, a line of code is worth a thousand explanations, so let’s take a simple example.

  Say we have a recipe object, which has the necessary information already stored within it, including an id.

  Then, we can save it by simply doing the following:

        // Assuming existingRecipeObj has all the necessary fields,
        // including id (say 13)
        var recipe = new Recipe(existingRecipeObj);
        recipe.$save();

  This will make a POST request to _/recipe/13_ . The @id tells it to pick the id field from its object and use that as the id parameter. It’s an added convenience that can save a few lines of code.

### Model

As services themselves can have dependencies, the Module API lets you define dependencies for your dependencies.

In most applications, it will work well enough to create a single module for all the code you create and put all of your dependencies in it. If you use services or directives from third-party libraries, they’ll come with their own modules. As your app depends on them, you’d refer to them as dependencies of your application’s module.

For instance, if you include the (fictitious) modules SnazzyUIWidgets and SuperDataSync, your application’s module declaration would look like this:

    var appMod = angular.module('app', ['SnazzyUIWidgets', 'SuperDataSync'];

### Directives

Directives extend HTML syntax, and are the way to associate behavior and DOM transformations with custom elements and attributes. Through them, you can create reusable UI components, configure your application, and do almost anything else you can imagine wanting to do in your UI template.

You can write apps with the built-in directives that come with Angular, but you’ll likely run into situations where you want to write your own. You’ll know it’s time to break into directives when you want to deal with browser events or modify the DOM in a way that isn’t already supported by the built-in directives. This code of yours belongs in a directive that you write, and not in a controller, service, or any other place in your app.

As with services, you define directives through the module object’s API by calling its directive() function, where directiveFunction is a factory function that defines your directive’s features.

    var appModule = angular.module('appModule', [...]);
    appModule.directive('directiveName', directiveFunction);

We can now move to the directives we will be using in our application. There will be two directives in the app:

- butterbar
  This directive will be shown and hidden when the routes change and while the page is still loading information. It will hook into the route-changing mechanism and automatically hide and show whatever is within its tag ,based on the state of the page.

- focus
  The focus directive is used to ensure that specific input fields (or elements) have the focus.

Let’s look at the code:

    // This file is app/scripts/directives/directives.js

    var directives = angular.module('guthub.directives', []);

    directives.directive('butterbar', ['$rootScope',
        function($rootScope) {
      return {
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
          element.addClass('hide');

          $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeStart', function() {
            element.removeClass('hide');
          });

          $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeSuccess', function() {
            element.addClass('hide');
          });
        }
      };
    }]);

    directives.directive('focus',
        function() {
      return {
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
          element[0].focus();
        }
      };
    });

Here, we’re returning the directive configuration object with its `link` function specified. The `link` function gets a reference to the enclosing scope, the DOM `element` it lives on, an array of any `attributes` passed to the directive, and the `controller` on the DOM element, if it exists. Here, we only need to get at the element and call its focus() method.

For now, all you need to know is the following:

1. Directives go through a two-step process. In the first step (the compile phase), all directives attached to a DOM element are found, and then processed. Any DOM manipulation also happens during the compile step. At the end of this phase, a linking function is produced.
2. In the second step, the link phase (the phase we used previously), the preceding DOM template produced is linked to the scope. Also, any watchers or listeners are added as needed, resulting in a live binding between the scope and the element. Thus, anything related to the scope happens in the linking phase.

The butterbar directive can be used as follows:

    <div butterbar>My loading text...</div>

It basically hides the element right up front, then adds two watches on the root scope. Every time a route change begins, it shows the element (by changing its class), and every time the route has successfully finished changing, it hides the butterbar again.

Another interesting thing to note is how we inject the $rootScope into the directive. All directives directly hook into the AngularJS dependency injection system, so you can inject your services and whatever else you need into them.

The final thing of note is the API for working with the element. jQuery veterans will be glad to know that it follows a jQuery-like syntax (addClass, removeClass). AngularJS implements a subset of the calls of jQuery so that jQuery is an optional dependency for any AngularJS project. In case you do end up using the full jQuery library in your project, you should know that AngularJS uses that instead of the jQlite implementation it has built-in.
