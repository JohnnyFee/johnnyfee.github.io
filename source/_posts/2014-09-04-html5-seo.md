### 1. Always Declare a Doctype

The doctype declaration should be the first thing in your HTML documents. The doctype declaration tells the browser about the XHTML standards you will be using and  helps  it  read and render your markup correctly.

I would recommend using the XHTML 1.0 strict doctype.  Some developers consider it a tough choice because this particular standard is less forgiving than loose or transitional doctype declarations, but it also ensures that your code abides strictly by the latest standards.

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//**DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict**//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
</pre>

### 2. Use Meaningful Title Tags

The `<title>` tag helps make a web page more meaningful and search-engine friendly. For example, the text inside the `<title>` tag appears in Google’s search engine results page, as well as in the user’s web browser bar and tabs.

Take for instance, the following example:

<pre>
<title>Six Revisions - Web Development and Design Information</title>
</pre>

The example above appears like the following image in Google’s search engine results page:

### 3. Use Descriptive Meta Tags

Meta tags make your web page more meaningful for user agents like search engine spiders.

#### Description Meta Attribute

The `description` meta attribute describes the basic purpose of your web page (a summary of what the web page contains). For each web page, you should place a consise and relevant summary inside the meta description tag.

For example, this description:

<pre>
<meta name="description" content="Six Revisions is a blog that shares useful information about web development and design, dedicated to people who build websites." />
</pre>

Shows up in Google’s search engine results page as follows:

![](http://images.sixrevisions.com/2010/08/22-02_description_example.png)

**Don’t try to spam your description** with repeated words and phrases because search engines are intelligent enough to detect that. Instead, just try to be simple and straightforward in explaining the purpose of your web page.

#### Keywords Meta Attribute

<pre>
<meta name="keywords" content="web design, web development" />
</pre>

The `keywords` meta attribute contains a comma-separated list of key words and phrases that relate to your web page. These keywords make your web page even more meaningful.

Again, just like with the `description` meta attribute, avoid repetition of words and phrases; just mention a few words that aptly describes and categorizes your web page.
